    <h2>The three sizing keywords</h2>
    <p>These keywords are used with sizing properties such as <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and their <code>min-*</code> and <code>max-*</code> forms. Note that in the following definitions we use the concept of a <em>"soft wrap opportunity"</em> which refers to the Browser performing a content wrapping at an allowed breakpoint.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The <code>min-content</code> keyword refers to the smallest measure that would fit around the content if all soft wrap opportunities within the box were taken:
    <h4 style="width: min-content; border: 1px dashed violet;">This is a great result for our business</h4></li>

    <li>The <code>max-content</code> keyword refers to the narrowest measure a box could take while fitting around the content if no soft wrap opportunities within the element were taken:
    <h4 style="width: max-content; border: 1px dashed violet;">This is a great result for our business</h4></li>

    <li>The <code>fit-content</code> keyword uses the available space but never less than <code>min-content</code> and never more than <code>max-content</code>:
    <h4 style="width: fit-content; border: 1px dashed violet;">This is a great result for our business</h4></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Some applications</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>A typical application is to center a block element of unknown size:
    <h4 style="width: fit-content; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 1px dashed violet;">This is a great result for our business</h4></li>

    <li>Another application is to center an element of unknown size in the page (look at the cross centered in the viewport). This is one of the few cases for which <code>height: fit-content</code> differs from <code>height: auto</code>.
    <div style="position: fixed; left: 0; right: 0; top: 0; bottom: 0; width: fit-content; height: fit-content; margin: auto; background: lightgoldenrodyellow; opacity: 0.25;">&cross;</div></li>
    </ul>

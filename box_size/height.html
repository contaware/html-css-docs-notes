    <ul>
        <li>The default for <code>height</code> is <code>auto</code>, which means that a element sets its height so that it can contain the children.</li>
        <li>As a parent wants to be the smallest height required to contain its children, to avoid a circular paradox, we have to give the parent a fixed height when the children use percentage heights.</li>
        <li>The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag has no parent, and if we set <code>height: 100%</code> for it, the viewport height is used.<br>The following works well: <code>html, body { height: 100%; }</code>.</li>
        <li>The <code>height</code> property with percent is calculated in two steps:
        <ol>
            <li>The height is read from the element's containing block, which usually is the parent element. But what height is read? If the element has a <code>position: static</code> (the default) or a <code>position: relative</code>, then the height is read from the <strong>content-box</strong> of the containing block, but if the element has a <code>position: absolute</code>, then the height will be read from the <strong>padding-box</strong> of the containing block.</li>
            <li>Now the above read height is applied to the element according to the element's <code>box-sizing</code> property (<code>box-sizing</code> is not inherited).</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div style="outline: 1px dashed violet; min-height: 120px; display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
        <h2 style="background: lightblue; margin: 0; padding: 10px;">Full height with flexbox</h2>
        <div style="background: peachpuff; flex-grow: 1;">When using <code>min-height</code> (or <code>max-height</code>) instead of <code>height</code> for a parent, we aren't giving the element a fixed size, this means that percentage heights do not work for the children. Fortunately we have flexbox to help us expand the children to the full height.</div>

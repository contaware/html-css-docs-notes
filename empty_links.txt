Proper ways for empty link
--------------------------

href="javascript:void(0);" -> does not seem to have any problems
href="javascript:;"        -> does not seem to have any problems
href="#"                   -> reloads the page
href=""                    -> reloads the page
href                       -> reloads the page
leave href out             -> no hint in status bar, cursor is not pointer (style with cursor: pointer)

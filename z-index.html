1. When the z-index and position properties aren't involved, the rules 
are pretty simple: basically, the stacking order is the same as the 
order of appearance in the HTML. 

2. CSS positioned elements (and their children) are displayed in front 
of any non-positioned elements. 

3. z-index only works on positioned elements. If you try to set a 
z-index on an element with no position specified, it will do nothing. 
z-index values create stacking contexts with a single HTML element as 
root element. When a new stacking context is formed on an element, that 
stacking context confines all of its child elements to a particular 
place in the stacking order.

4. CSS opacity also create stacking contexts. In addition to opacity, 
several newer CSS properties also create stacking contexts. These 
include: transforms, filters, css-regions, paged media, and possibly 
others. 

Here are the basic rules to determine stacking order within a single 
stacking context (from back to front): 

- The stacking context's root element
- Positioned elements (and their children) with negative z-index values 
- Non-positioned elements
- Positioned elements (and their children) with a z-index value of auto 
  (auto sets the stacking level to 0 and does not establish a new stacking context)
- Positioned elements (and their children) with positive z-index values 

Note: it becomes possible for an element to appear behind its own parent. 
      This will only work if the element's parent is in the same stacking 
      context and is not the root element of that stacking context.

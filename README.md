# HTML/CSS Docs & Notes 

This is not a HTML or CSS programming reference guide or a learning book, it is a collection of files containing notes and code subdivided by subject.

All **our documents are licensed** under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), while **our code snippets/examples are in public domain** because they do not meat the threshold of originality. Bear in mind that if two programmers provide substantially the same code snippets/examples for a given task, then that's considered non-original. Nevertheless, to reassure everyone, we explicitly release our code snippets/examples into the public domain under the [CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license.

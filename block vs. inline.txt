Block level elements
--------------------

Block level elements are elements of the source document that are 
formatted visually as blocks. In other words, block level elements are 
normally displayed as blocks with line breaks before and afterwards: 
- div, p, h1-h6, hr
- ol, ul, dl
- li, dt, dd
- pre, address
- header, nav, footer, main, section, article, aside 
- blockquote
- form, fieldset
- table


Inline elements
---------------

Inline elements are elements of the source document that do not form new 
blocks of content; the content is distributed in lines. So, inline 
content is displayed with no line breaks before or afterwards: 
- span, a, br
- b, i, em, strong, code, sub, sup
- label

If you try to add dimensions to an inline element, some properties will 
be applied, some properties will be partially applied and others will 
not be applied at all: 
1. The above mentioned inline elements do not have width and height
   (the height of the box is usually given by the line-height property). 
2. While padding / margin / border can be applied to all sides of an inline 
   element, only left and right padding / margin will have an effect on 
   surrounding content. When the inline element is split across more than 
   one line, the horizontal padding / margin / border are only applied to 
   the start of the first line and the end of the last line. 

The following inline elements have width and height:
- button, input, select, textarea
- img, video, iframe (replaced elements)

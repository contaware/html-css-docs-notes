The <img>'s width and height attributes
---------------------------------------

Those attributes are the weakest kind of styling, they are overridden 
by any css styling information, even for selectors with very low 
specificity. Setting the width and height attributes is still a good 
idea, as they are fallback sizing and sizing information as the page is 
loading.


Images for High DPI displays
----------------------------

<img src="images/image-1x.jpg" srcset="images/image-1x.jpg 1x,images/image-4x.jpg 4x" alt="image" width="100" height="220">

or just use bigger images:

logo.png is like 300 x 180, on 96 DPI the browser will scale them on 
higher DPI it can use the full resolution:
<img src="images/logo.png" alt="logo" width="100" height="60">
